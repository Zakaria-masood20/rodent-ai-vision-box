## Development Process

### Setting Up Development Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rodent-ai-vision-box.git
cd rodent-ai-vision-box

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install development dependencies
make dev-install
```

### Code Style

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black** for code formatting
- **isort** for import sorting
- **flake8** for linting
- **mypy** for type checking

Run all checks:
```bash
make check-all
```

Format code:
```bash
make format
```

### Testing

Write tests for any new functionality:

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_detection_engine.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

## Documentation

- Update docstrings for all public functions
- Use Google-style docstrings
- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Update technical documentation for implementation details

Example docstring:
```python
def detect_rodents(image: np.ndarray, confidence: float = 0.25) -> List[Detection]:
    """Detect rodents in an image.
    
    Args:
        image: Input image as numpy array (H, W, C).
        confidence: Minimum confidence threshold for detections.
    
    Returns:
        List of Detection objects containing bounding boxes and classes.
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If image is not in correct format.
    """
```

## Release Process

1. Update version in `setup.py` and `pyproject.toml`
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create pull request to `main`
4. After merge, tag the release: `git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"`
5. Push tags: `git push origin --tags`
