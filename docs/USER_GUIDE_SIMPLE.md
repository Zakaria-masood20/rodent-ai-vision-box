---

## Daily Use

### What Happens Automatically:

- ‚úÖ **Watches 24/7** - Never stops monitoring
- ‚úÖ **Sends alerts** - Texts you when rats appear
- ‚úÖ **Saves pictures** - Keeps photos of detections
- ‚úÖ **Prevents spam** - Waits 10 minutes between alerts

### What You'll See:

**Normal Text Alert:**
```
üö® RODENT ALERT!
Norway Rat detected at 3:45 PM
with 85% confidence.
```

**What the message means:**
- **"Norway Rat"** or **"Roof Rat"** = Type of rat (not always accurate)
- **Time** = When it was seen
- **Confidence** = How sure the system is (higher is better)

### Understanding Rat Types:

- **Norway Rat** = Larger, ground-dwelling rat (system is 77% accurate)
- **Roof Rat** = Smaller, climbing rat (system is only 15% accurate)
- **Important:** The system is good at detecting "a rat is there" but may confuse which type

---

## Common Questions

### Q: I'm not getting text messages

**Check these things:**

1. **Is the black box on?** (green light should be on)
2. **Is your phone number correct?** (must have +1 at the start)
3. **Do you have Twilio credits?** (free trial gives you $15)
4. **Is the camera recording?** (check Wyze app)

### Q: I'm getting too many messages

The system waits 10 minutes between alerts. If you want to change this:
- Contact support to adjust the "cooldown time"

### Q: The system says "Roof Rat" but it looks like a Norway Rat

This is normal. The system is still learning the difference. It's better at detecting "there's a rat" than identifying which type.

### Q: How do I turn it off?

Simply unplug the black box. Plug it back in to restart.

### Q: How do I see the pictures?

The system saves pictures of detected rats. Ask your technician how to access them.
